# Project Overview
The Cafe Management System is a simple Python program designed to simulate a basic ordering system for a cafe. Customers can order items from a predefined menu, and the system calculates the total cost of the order. This project is a great starting point for beginners to understand basic Python concepts such as classes, dictionaries, user input, and loops.

### Features
1. Displays a menu of available items with their prices.
2. Allows customers to order items from the menu.
3. Calculates and displays the total amount for the order.
4. Handles scenarios where an item is not available.
5. Uses object-oriented programming principles.

Here in this I have used the class, object, loops concept to make my project more readable and structures.
